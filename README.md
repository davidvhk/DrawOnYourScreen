## Tips and tricks

* Power is nothing without control:

 The `Ctrl` key provides an extra functionality for each tool.

* Draw arrows:

 Intersect two lines and curve the second thanks to the `Ctrl` key.

* Duplicate an element:

 Hold the `Shift` key while starting moving.

* Insertable images:

 You can insert images (jpeg, png, svg) in your drawings. By default images are sought in `~/.local/share/draw-on-your-screen/images/` but the location is configurable in the preferences. Another way is to copy-past the images from Nautilus or any clipboard source by using the usual `Ctrl + V` shortcut inside the drawing mode.

* Eraser and SVG:

 There is no eraser in SVG so when you export elements made with the eraser to a SVG file, they are colored with the background color, transparent if it is disabled. See `“Add a drawing background”` or edit the SVG file afterwards.

* Screenshot Tool extension:

 [Screenshot Tool](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1112/screenshot-tool/) is a convenient extension to “create, copy, store and upload screenshots”. In order to select a screenshoot area with your pointer while keeping the drawing in place, you need first to tell DrawOnYourScreen to ungrab the pointer (`Ctrl + Super + Alt + D`).

* Color Picker extension:

 If the GNOME Shell built-in color picker is too basic for you, have a look at the [Color Picker extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3396/color-picker), which let's you select the pixel accurately, preview the color and adjust its values. Once installed and enabled, it will be transparently integrated into DrawOnYourScreen.
